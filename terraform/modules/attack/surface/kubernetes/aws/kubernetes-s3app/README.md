Based on your scenario, we'll set up a standard Kubernetes environment with the following components, adhering to the namespace requirements and aligning with the exploit scenario:

1. **Web Service Pod with Flask App**: This pod runs a Python Flask application. It will be compromised initially and will have a service account with permissions to list all pods in the same namespace.

2. **Redis Pod**: A Redis instance pod that is misconfigured to allow write access from other pods in the same namespace.

3. **Worker/Logger Pod**: This pod consumes data from Redis. It's vulnerable to unsafe deserialization or a similar vulnerability. It will have a service account with permissions to access certain resources, which the attacker will exploit.

4. **S3 Bucket Access**: The final target pod (web service pod) will have IAM role permissions to interact with an S3 bucket, from which data will be exfiltrated.

Let's start by creating the Kubernetes manifests for each of these components. First, we'll create a Deployment and Service for the web service pod with its Flask application. This deployment will include a ServiceAccount with specific permissions as per the scenario.
