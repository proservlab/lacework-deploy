# Custom Scenarios Directory

This directory is excluded from change tracking the repository and is reserved for future use. See the `scenarios_path` variable for overriding the default scenarios directory. Path can be absolute or relative, where relative paths are relative to the provider subdirectory (e.g. aws, gcp, azure). The default `scenarios_path` value is `../scenarios`.
